    <string name="terms"><h2><b>Terms and conditions</b></h2> \n

    <p>These terms and conditions ("Agreement") set forth the
        general terms and conditions of your use of the ("KIBU-OLX") mobile
        application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related
        products and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is
        legally binding between you ("User", "you" or "your") and this Mobile
        Application developer ("Operator", "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing
        and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you
        have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
        Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a
        business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
        authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms
        ("User", "you" or "your") shall refer to such entity. If you do not have
        such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement,
        you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the
        Mobile Application and Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a
        contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and
        is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile
        Application and Services</p>\n
    <h2><b>Accounts and membership</b></h2>\n
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Mobile Application
and Services. By using the Mobile Application and Services and by
agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at
least 18 years of age. If you create an account in the Mobile
Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your
account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur
under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We
may monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start
using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may
result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify
us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part
thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this
Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our
reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing
reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your
email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further
registration.</p>\n
<h2><b>User content</b></h2>\n
<p>We do not own any data, information or material (collectively,
"Content") that you submit in the Mobile Application in the course of
using the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy,
quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and
intellectual property ownership or right to use of all submitted
Content. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review the
Content in the Mobile Application submitted or created using our
Services by you. You grant us permission to access, copy, distribute,
store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your user
account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to
you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we
have the right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole
discretion, refuse or remove any Content that, in our reasonable
opinion, violates any of our policies or is in any way harmful or
objectionable. You also grant us the license to use, reproduce, adapt,
modify, publish or distribute the Content created by you or stored in
your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar purpose.</p>\n
<h2><b>Backups</b></h2>\n
<p>We perform regular backups of the Content and will do our best to
ensure completeness and accuracy of these backups. In the event of the
hardware failure or data loss we will restore backups automatically to
minimize the impact and downtime.</p>\n
<h2><b>Links to other resources</b></h2>\n
<p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other
resources (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not,
directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship,
 endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless
specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or
evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or
individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any
responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and
content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the
legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you
access through a link in the Mobile Application and Services. Your
linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>\n
<h2><b>Prohibited uses</b></h2>\n
<p>In addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are
prohibited from using the Mobile Application and Services or Content:
(a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or
participate in any unlawful acts; (c) to violate any international,
federal, provincial or state regulations, rules, laws, or local
ordinances; (d) to infringe upon or violate our intellectual property
rights or the intellectual property rights of others; (e) to harass,
abuse, insult, harm, defame, slander, disparage, intimidate, or
discriminate based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity,
race, age, national origin, or disability; (f) to submit false or
misleading information; (g) to upload or transmit viruses or any other
type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way that will
affect the functionality or operation of the Mobile Application and
Services, third party products and services, or the Internet; (h) to
spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (i) for any
obscene or immoral purpose; or (j) to interfere with or circumvent the
security features of the Mobile Application and Services, third party
products and services, or the Internet. We reserve the right to
terminate your use of the Mobile Application and Services for violating
any of the prohibited uses.</p>\n
<h2><b>Intellectual property rights</b></h2>\n
<p>("Intellectual Property Rights") means all present and future rights
conferred by statute, common law or equity in or in relation to any
copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents, inventions,
goodwill and the right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions,
rights to use, and all other intellectual property rights, in each case
whether registered or unregistered and including all applications and
rights to apply for and be granted, rights to claim priority from, such
rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection and
any other results of intellectual activity which subsist or will subsist
 now or in the future in any part of the world. This Agreement does not
transfer to you any intellectual property owned by the Operator or third
 parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property
will remain (as between the parties) solely with the Operator. All
trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with
the Mobile Application and Services, are trademarks or registered
trademarks of the Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service
marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Mobile Application
 and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of
the Mobile Application and Services grants you no right or license to
reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator or third party
trademarks.</p>\n
<h2><b>Limitation of liability</b></h2>\n
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
the Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect,
incidental, special, punitive, cover or consequential damages
(including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue,
sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business
interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity)
 however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty,
negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to
 the possibility of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To
 the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability
 of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
suppliers and licensors relating to the services will be limited to an
amount greater of one dollar or any amounts actually paid in cash by you
 to the Operator for the prior one month period prior to the first event
 or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and
exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for
any losses or fails of its essential purpose.</p>\n
<h2><b>Indemnification</b></h2>\n
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors harmless
 from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including
reasonable attorneys fees, incurred in connection with or arising from
any third party allegations, claims, actions, disputes, or demands
asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content,
 your use of the Mobile Application and Services or any willful
misconduct on your part.</p>\n
<h2><b>Severability</b></h2>\n
<p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be
exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that
they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited
to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement
illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention
of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall
constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in
full force and effect.</p>\n
<h2><b>Dispute resolution</b></h2>\n
<p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and
any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the substantive and
procedural laws of Kenya without regard to its rules on conflicts or
choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Kenya. The
exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject
matter hereof shall be the courts located in Kenya, and you hereby
submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any
 right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to
this Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>\n

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms relating
to the Mobile Application and Services at any time, effective upon
posting of an updated version of this Agreement in the Mobile
Application. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom
